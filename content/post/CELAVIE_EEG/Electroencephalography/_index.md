To study empathy and creativity, high-level cognitive phenomena, one of the approaches taken was to record high-density (128-channel) **resting-state EEG** (electroencephalograpy). Resting-state (RS) EEG was recorded to enable to study of **micro-state** activity and, having recorded high-density RS EEG allows us to carry out to source localisation to confirm the localisation of the micro-state generators and, therefore, confirm that a given, detected micro-state corresponds to a certain **resting-state network** (RSN).
