The following figures present a summary of the number and spatial location of the channels rejected, per participant, during the preprocessing carried out by the RELAX pipeline as well as the total time (in seconds) rejected per participant.

The total rejected time for each participant is presented above each bar. This corresponds to the data rejected during the pre-MWF extreme data rejection. ")
