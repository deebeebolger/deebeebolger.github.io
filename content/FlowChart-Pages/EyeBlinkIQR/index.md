This method creates a mask that specifies the localisation of eye-blinks in the continuous EEG by using an inter-quartile range threshold.

This method is applied in the second round of Multi-channel Wiener Filtering (MWF) and so, if at least the first and second rounds of MWF are being carried out, it is not necessary to carry out this step here.

In the RELAX config, the user specifies the probability that data does not have blinks as follows:

- 0 $\implies$data almost certainly has blinks
- 1 $\implies$data might not have blinks
- 2 $\implies$data definitely does not have blinks

As data entered into the pipeline is resting-state data and the participants should have had their eyes closed during EEG acquisition, we specify the probability as 1, the data might not have blinks. For probabilities of 0 or 1, the IQR method is applied to detect and mark eye-blinks. 

To facilitate blink detection using this method, channels most likely to present blink artifacts are defined in the RELAX config. The following are the channels defined:

- RELAX_cfg.BlinkElectrodes = C29, C17, C16, C30, C8, C27, C21, C13, C10
- RELAX_cfg.HEOGLeftpattern = C30, D7, D8, D9, D23, D10, D22, D24, C31
- RELAX_cfg.HEOGRightpattern = C8, C7, B27, B28, B26, B29, B24, B14, C9

The positions of each of these channels are indicated in the following figure.
