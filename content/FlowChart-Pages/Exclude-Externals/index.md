In the RELAX_cfg file, this parameter is called ***ElectrodesToDelete***. This information should be based on electrodes noted in the *cahier de manip* (lab notebook). By default, it is blank. In the CLV implementation, the following electrodes are marked for exclusion:

- GSR1, GSR2, Erg1, Erg2, Resp, Plet, Temp, EXG1, EXG2, EXG3, EXG4, EXG5, EXG6, EXG7, EXG8

These channels to reject are defined in the RELAX config as follows:
