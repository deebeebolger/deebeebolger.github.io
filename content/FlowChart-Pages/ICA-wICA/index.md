The computed ICs (Independent Components) are automatically classified using EEGLABâ€™s ICLabel plugin. The algorithms underlying the automatic classification of ICs is based on crowd sourcing run by the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, University of California, which involves experts contributing to the ICLabel project by volunteering to label components. The ICLabel plugin automatically classifies ICs into broad categories based on their source:

- Brain
- Muscle
- Oculare
- Cardiac
- Channel noise
- Line noise
- Other
